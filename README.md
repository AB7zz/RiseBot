# What can this bot do?
1. The bot can detect if a user is feeling down or depressed and immediately make immediate actions like sending human-like encouraging messages, motivational quotes, etc...

2. It simplifies the task of searching questions on StackOverflow and the bot directly provides the best answer and the links to the user

3. In case the user wants to play any music while coding, he/she can join in a voice channel and command the bot to play there.

4. If the user is taking a break and wishes to see an anime/movie/tv-shows, he/she can ask the bot to provide some suggestions. As the bot is a programming assistant it provides movies related to programming and coding
